# Ghost Selector
S&amp;ASRT mod that allows you to select a ghost in time attack.

# How to install:

Open the zip file and extract the "Ghost Selector" folder to somewhere on your computer. The folder can be placed anywhere you like.

# How to use:
1. Start the game, then open the EXE file.

2. Choose a rival ghost from the available options:
   * No rival --> Disables the rival ghost (but not your PB).
   * Default rival --> One position above you on your leaderboard.
   * Specific rank --> Selects the ghost at fixed position on the leaderboard.
   * Fastest player --> Automatically pick the fastest ghost out of a list of players. You need to know their Steam ID (called steamID64). Go to a players Steam profile, copy the website address, paste it here: https://steamid.io and click lookup.
   * Load from file --> Load ghost from a file saved on your computer.
3. Choose graphics options under the "Extra Options" tab to customise ghost appearance.
4. Optionally, save each lap in time attack to a ghost file. You can open one of these later by using the "Load from file" option when choosing a rival ghost.
5. Click the "Save and Apply" button, return to the games main menu to make sure everything is applied. You're all set!

# Notes:
* Your selections will be lost when the game is closed. However the program will remember your choices, just reopen the program and click "Save and Apply" again.
* If nothing is happening after applying your choices, try right clicking on the EXE file and clicking "Run as Administrator".
