# S&ASRT Ghost Selector
S&amp;ASRT mod that allows you to select a ghost in time attack.

How to install:

Open the zip file and extract the two files to somewhere on your computer. The files do not need to be placed in a specific directory. 

How to use:
1. Start the game, then open the EXE file.

2. Choose one of the two ghost selectors:
  * Position --> Selects the ghost at chosen position on the leaderboard. Position 0 = ghost disabled (but your PB ghost still shows).
  * Fastest Player --> Selects the fastest ghost out of a list of players. You need to know their Steam ID (called steamID64). Go to a players Steam profile, copy the website address, paste it here: https://steamid.io and click lookup.

3. Choose options under "Graphics Options".

4. Click the "Save and Apply" button, return to the games main menu to make sure everything is applied. You're all set!

Notes:
*Your selections will be lost when the game is closed. However the program will remember your choices, just reopen the program and click "Save and Apply" again.
*If nothing is happening after applying your choices, try right clicking on the EXE file and clicking "Run as Administrator".
